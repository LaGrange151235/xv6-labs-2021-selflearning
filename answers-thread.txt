The reason for missing is that if two or more threads insert entries into the same bucket at the same time. They may insert different entries at the same address, which is the tail of that bucket at that time. This situation will cause missing. So, if we aquire lock of each bucket before we put entries into it, we can ensure that this situation won't occurr. By this lock policy, we will have only 0.2*0.2=0.04 posibility to meet confict between two threads, which can ensure the speedup.
